## Pre Lecture

`a && b` runs command `a`, and iff command `a` is successful, it will run command `b`.
`a || b` runs command `a`, and if  `a` worked, it won't run  `b`. If  `a` failed, then it would run `b`.
`a ; b` runs `a` then `b`, regardless of the commands fail or not.

- `javac` only takes in files as arguments, not standard input. 

`xargs` converts everything following that which is standard input to arguments.

`find` searches for a file in a directory hierarchy, for example to find any file with this property in any folder: `find -name *.java`

`echo` takes a string and prints it back out
`cut -cx` removes a character `x` from the input 
`cut -d,` splits it by commas
`cut -d -fx` picks out the remaining "column" `x`. 

```
command | command
command < file > file
command < file | command
coommand < file | command > file
```

### Kevin Lin Wants Us to Cite Our Sources

- use `# this is my source` to cite files. 

### Homework 3 tips

If you have a `directories.txt` file with the name of directories we want.
