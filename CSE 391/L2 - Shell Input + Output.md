## Lecture Notes

Shell expansion? `echo 24s{p, u}/materials` -> `24sp/materials` and `24su/materials`

#### Pipping
`a | b` -> basically takes the output of the first command and use it as the input to the second command.

`sort | uniq`, sorting the files and then checking which lines are different. 

`ls -a ..` prints all hidden files in parent directory
`ls -a .. | wc` prints the number of files in the parent directory (including hidden ones)
