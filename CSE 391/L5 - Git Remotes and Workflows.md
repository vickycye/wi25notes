## Lecture Pre-work

How do you collaborate with others using git?

Vocab:
`repository` -> copy of all files (and changes) / everyone has their own repository
`committ` -> a group of changes to files
`branch` -> a pointer to the commit
`HEAD` -> the branch/commit you are currently working on

4 Stages of git: 
1. working directory
2. staging area
3. local repo
4. remote repo

`hacker-matt` is a collaborative shell

### Reset and Rebase

`git reset` moves the HEAD reference to a different commit -> loses changes that teammates make (have to pull first)
`git rebase` can re-apply commits, clean local history before pushing commits

### Homework 5 Stuff

1. Add your own product
2. Review someone else's merge request
