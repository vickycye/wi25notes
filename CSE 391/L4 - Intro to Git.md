## Prework Notes

`git switch -c main` -> switches to main branch
`touch README.md` -> make a README
`git status` -> gives some info about repository

`git add` -> `git commit -m "message"` -> `git push -u origin main`

### 4 Stages of Git

`git restore --staged <file>` removes it from being staged

`git log` shows you all the commits that you've done

`git log --graph --oneline`
