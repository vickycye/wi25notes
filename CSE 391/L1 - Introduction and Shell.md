<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Linux kernel</mark> examples: ChromeOS and Android.
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Unix kernel</mark> examples: maxOS, iOS
Windows has its own kernel.

- We usually use computers with desktop environments, such as keyboards, a mouse, or touchscreen.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Shell</mark> is the most direct way to write programs that interact with files -> significantly less than normal Java code. 

Linux is the most deployed OS in the world. Powers most web servers and cloud computing.

`[vickyye@attu3 ~]$` is the system prompt
`~` symbol represents the home folder
To get folder structure, use `pwd`: `/homes/iws/vickyye`

`cd` means change directory
`ls` lists all the files
`pwd` means print working directory
`cd ..` gets to a folder structure higher
`clear` clears the history but keeps the current location in the directory
`mkdir` makes a new folder/directory
`man` bring up manual for a command
`cat` opens the file (can read two files in the same time) [concatenate files and print on the standard output]
`exit` log out of shell
`.`references working directory
`..` references parent working directory
`cp` copy file
`mv` move a file/rename a file
`rm` remove given file
`nano` text editor, very simple
`vim` advanced text editor
`emacs` another advanced text editor
