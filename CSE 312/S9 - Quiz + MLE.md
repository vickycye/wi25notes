### Quick Notes
- "Bias" is important in ML
- "This is cap" - Ameya, when talking about a t/f problem

### To do
- [ ] Finish homework 7

### Quiz Prep

There will be _Two_ main questions on the quiz:

1. A question on continuous random variable fundamentals. This question will have multiple parts, and may include things like
	- Given a PDF, compute the probability of an event
	- Given a CDF, compute the PDF
	- Given a PDF, compute the expectation of a function of a random variable.
	- And similar questions
3. A question on using normal distributions. This question will have multiple parts, and may include things like
	- Using the Central Limit Theorem to approximate a distribution (including continuity correction)
	- inverse questions (given a probability, find the input to the CDF that produces it)
	- And similar questions

5. There may be small additional questions (say a few multiple choice/true-false questions)

# THE TABLE OF KNOWLEDGE.

| pmf | Probability mass function        | Discrete   | $p_{Y}(k) \geq 0$ | $\sum_{\omega} p_{Y}(\omega) = 1$      |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| pdf | Probability density function     | Continuous | $f_{X}(k) \geq 0$ | $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X}(k)dk = 1$ |
| cdf | Cumulative distribution function | Continuous |                   |                                        |
| cdf | Cumulative distribution function | Discrete   |                   |                                        |
|     |                                  |            |                   |                                        |
Important:
- Impossible events have probability 0
- But some probability 0 events are still possible

### Actual Section - Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Bar notation and semicolon notation means the same thing $p_{X}(x_{i}; \theta)$ and $p_{X}(x_{i} | \theta)$, but this does NOT mean conditional probability
