### Quick notes
- If you haven't drawn the data we can use the random variable during MLE
- But if we've already ran the experiment, we use the numerical data points

### To do
- [ ] Type up and submit homework 8
- [ ] Print stuff
- [ ] Write thank you email to Robbie

Covariance matrix:
[Covariance Matrix: Definition, Formula with Solved Examples - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/covariance-matrix/)

Gives us a matrix of variances between variables:
- The diagonal should be variances for each variable
- Everything else should be the covariance between variables

[standard deviation - Why is the correlation coefficient always smaller than $1$ and bigger than $-1$? - Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/541566/why-is-the-correlation-coefficient-always-smaller-than-1-and-bigger-than-1)

- For circular graphs, covariance is usually 0
- Otherwise, if we have a positive covariance, it should be positively slanted, and if it's negative, it should be negatively slanted.
- $X_{1}$ is always the x-axis, $X_2$ is always the y-axis, for Robbie's class at least.

The majors and minors of the ellipses int eh graphs were the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The associated eigenvalues tell you how the directions should be weighted. Ellipses are the equivalence of confidence intervals. 

- If you change the mean, the covariance matrix doesn't change.
