### Conditional Probability

$\mathbb{P}($red die is 6 conditioned on sum 7$)$: $$\frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{6}{36}} = \frac{1}{6}$$
$\mathbb{P}($red die is 6 conditioned on sum 9$)$: 
$$\frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{4}{36}} = \frac{1}{4}$$

$\mathbb{P}($sum is 7 conditioned on the red die being 6$)$: 
$$\frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{6}{36}} = \frac{1}{6}$$

The first an third example are a coincidence that it's the same.

### Bayes' Rule

Bayes' Rule is basically how your assumptions change given new information. 

$$\mathbb{P}(A \vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \vert A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$$

### Law of Total Probability

$\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(B \vert A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B \vert \bar{A}) \cdot \mathbb{P}(\bar{A})$
= probability you're alerted and you have a golden ticket + probability you're alerted and you don't have a golden ticket

==Formal Definition==
$$\mathbb{P}(E) = \sum_{\text{all } i}^{} \mathbb{P}(E \vert A_i) \mathbb{P}(A_i)$$
