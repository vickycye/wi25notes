## Lecture Notes

- We can do a two sample t test for differences in each possible pair of groups to determine which pair of means that are differing. But if there are a lot of groups, then that's a lot of t tests.
- If we run too many tests, a Type 1 error rate increases

### Linear Regression
**Residuals** are the leftovers from the model fit: Data = Fit + Residual
![[residuals_lr.png]]

Residual = Observed - predicted

### Fitting a line by least squares regression
##### Least Squares Line [clarify this by googling]
$$\hat{y} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x$$
- y hat is the predicted value of the response variable
- beta 0 is the intercept, of the parameter
	- b 0 is the intercept of the point estimate
- beta 1 is the slope of the parameter
	- b 1 is the slope of the point estiamate
- x is the explanatory variable

Conditions for least squares line:
1. Linearity [We can use a residual plot to determine this]
2. Nearly normal residuals 
3. Constant variability

Slope of the regression is calculated by $$b_{1} = \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}R$$
