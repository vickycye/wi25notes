Types of variables:

![[types_of_variables.png]]

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Numerical Data</mark>: This type of data consists of numbers which represent measures or counts. 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Continuous Data</mark>:
- Data that can take any value within a given range (including fractions or decimals)
- Key Characteristic: It can assume an infinite number of values within a range, and it typically results from measurement.
- Examples: Height, weight, temperature, time, or any measurement where values can be infinitely subdivided.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Discrete Data</mark>:
- Definition: Data that consists of distinct, separate values. These values are usually counts and cannot be divided further.
- Key Characteristic: These values are often whole numbers, and they result from counting events or objects.
- Examples: # of children in a family, # of cars in a parking lot, # of students in a class.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Categorical Data</mark>: This type of data represents categories or groups. It deals with qualitative traits or characteristics rather than numeric values.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ordinal Data</mark>:
- Definition: Data that has categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between the categories are not necessarily uniform or measurable.
- Key Characteristic: The categories have a natural order, but the distance between the categories isn’t uniform or defined.
- Examples: Education level (e.g., high school, bachelor’s, master’s), customer satisfaction (e.g., very dissatisfied, neutral, very satisfied), Likert scale ratings (e.g., strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree).

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Nominal Data </mark>(Non-Ordinal):
- Definition: Data that consists of categories without any inherent order or ranking.
- Key Characteristic: The categories are purely labels, and there is no meaningful order or ranking between them.
- Examples: Colors (e.g., red, blue, green), types of animals (e.g., dog, cat, rabbit), countries (e.g., USA, India, Brazil).

>Example: A telephone area code is: categorical

explanatory variable -> response variable

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Observational studies</mark>: Collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise (e.g. surveys).
- Can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Experiment</mark>: Researchers randomly assign subjects to various treatments in order to establish causal connections between the explanatory and response variables.

When two variables show association with each other, they're called <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">associated</mark> variables $\leftrightarrow$ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">dependent</mark> variables. 

If there is no association, it's called an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">independent</mark> variable.

### Sampling Principles and Strategies

Sampling the entire population is called a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">census</mark>.
Sampling rules:
- Has to be natural
- Has to be representative
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Exploratory analysis</mark> is generalizing for the whole population from a small sample, making a conclusion is called an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inference</mark>.

Types of non-representative responses:
- **Non-response** is if only a small fraction of the population responded to a survey, so it's not representative of the population.
- **Voluntary response** is where participants volunteer to complete a survey, not representative of the population.
- **Convenience Sample** is also not representative because people are chosen at convenience, and it doesn't represent the whole population.

> Anecdotal evidence is not true evidence, not representative of population.

Types of random sampling:
- Simple Random Sample (SRS): randomly select points from the population.
- Stratified Sample: Each stratum is a "layer" of population we choose from. Then, we randomly choose from each strata.
- Cluster Random Sample (CRS): Take a simple random sample of clusters, and sample all the observations in that cluster. **This is usually preferred for economical reasons.**

### Experiments

1. Control: Control for the (potential) effect of variables other than the ones directly being studied.

2. Randomize: Randomly assign subjects to treatments, and randomly sample from the population whenever possible.

3. Replicate: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study.

4. Block: If there are variables that are known or suspected to affect the response variable, first group subjects into blocks based on these variables, and then randomize cases within each block to treatment groups.

#### More Experiment Details
- Placebo: fake treatment, often used as the control group for medical studies
- Placebo effect: experimental units showing improvement simply because they believe they are receiving a special treatment
- Blinding: when experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group
- Double-blind: when both the experimental units and the researchers who interact with the patients do not know who is in the control and who is in the treatment group

### Other

Simpson demonstrated that a statistical relationship observed within a population could be reversed within all subgroups that make up the population.
