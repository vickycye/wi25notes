### Lab Notes

Bootstrapping is resampling from our sample to infer what our population is like. We treat the sample itself as the population and sample (with replacement) from teh sample. 

1. Resample to get a sample of the same size
2. Calculate the proportion
3. Repeat this a bunch of times
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the estimates

Why use bootstrap?
- Simple to use and can be used on complicated estimators
- Can't always make normality assumptions needed for the Central Limit Theorem
- Asymptotically very accurate

A permutation test is a non-parametric statistical test that evaluates the significance of an observed effect by resampling the data without relying on distributional assumptions. 
We start by calculating the difference in means in the observed sample between two groups A and B. Then we look at possible reshufflings of the data, reassigning values A and B, and calculate the difference in means for all the different permutations of the data.
