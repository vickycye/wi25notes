### Quick notes
- When is prof gonna show up :(
- Medical research is usually double-blind
- we will be building histograms

### To do
- ~~Finish homework practice set on Canvas~~
- Read chapter 1 of textbook
- Do practice problems in chapter 1 of textbook
- Take lecture notes for today (from canvas)??

## Lecture Notes

### Properties of Experimental Design
1. Control: control group
2. Randomize: randomly assign subject to treatments, and randomly sample the subjects
3. Replicate: Within a study, have enough of a large sample
4. Block: block variables -> randomize cases within each block to treatment groups.
	1. Characteristics that the experimental units come with, that we would like to control for
	2. Similar to stratifying, except used in experimental settings when randomly assigning, as opposed to when sampling.

- A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">confounding variable</mark> is a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and the response variable.
- Relationships between two variables of interest may be in the opposite direction from intuition, because of the influence of other variables.
### Center of Distributions

The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">mean</mark>, also called the average, is one way to measure the center of a distribution of data.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sample mean</mark>: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i}{n} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}$ , $n$ observed values. [more generally a sample statistic / point estimate]
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Population mean</mark>: $\mu$, it's often not possible to calculate this since population data are rarely available and hard to get. 

In the context of random variables, the mean is also called the Expected value, denoted as $E(X)$.


### Types of diagrams:
- Dot plot
- Stacked dot plot
![[stacked_dot_plot.png]]
- Histograms [higher density, higher frequency in a certain interval]
![[histogram_example.png]]
	- Provide a view of data density, higher bars represent more common data.
	- Convenient for describing the shape of the data distribution.
	- Bin width is the width of the bar, basically.


### Shape of a Distribution - Modality
- single peak (unimodal)
- several prominent peaks (multimodal)
- no apparent peaks (uniform)

### Shape of a Distribution - Skewness
- which direction the tail is facing
- right skewed
- left skewed
- symmetric

### Shape of a Distribution - Outliers
- weird parts of data
