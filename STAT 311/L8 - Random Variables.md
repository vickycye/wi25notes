## Lecture Notes

1. Definition of random variables
2. The Normal distribution
3. The Binomial distribution

### Random Variables

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Discrete Random Variables</span> often only take integer values. [number of credits]
<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">C</span><span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">ontinuous random variables</span> take real decimal values. [cost of books this quarter]

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Expected Value</span> is usually denoted $E(X)$, which is a weighted average of all the possible outcomes
$$\mu = E(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} x_i \mathbb{P}(X = x_i)$$
$x_i$ is all the possible values of the sample space. 

Variability:
$$\sigma^2 = Var(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} (x_i - E(X))^2 \mathbb{P}(X = x_i)$$
A <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">linear combination</span> of random variables $X$ and $Y$ is $aX + bY$:
$$E(aX + bY) = a \cdot E(X) + b \cdot E(Y)$$

Probability density function is a smooth curve.

### Normal Distribution
1. Unimodal
2. Symmetric
3. Bell shaped
4. Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal
5. Denoted as $N(\mu, \sigma)$

- talked about z-scores
- Z = observation - mean / sd
