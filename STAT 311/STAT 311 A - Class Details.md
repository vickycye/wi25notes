# 🌍 What It's About

Elements of good study design. Descriptive statistics including correlation and regression. Introductory concepts of probability and sampling; binomial and normal distributions. Basic concepts of hypothesis testing, estimation, and confidence intervals; t-tests and chi-square tests. Experience with computer software.

STAT 311 is a modern introduction to the discipline of statistics. Students are immersed in realistic  
data-driven tasks from the start of the quarter and will learn to navigate their way using a mix of  
statistics, computer literacy, and last but not least, good old-fashioned common sense.

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Identify limitations in data collection methods and explain how this limits the scope of inference.  
2. Use the programming language R to summarize patterns in data visually and numerically.  
3. Explain the unifying logic of statistical inference.  
4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables, and also the relationship between a numerical response and a binary predictor.  
5. Model a numerical response using a numerical and categorical predictors.  
6. Make data-based decisions.
