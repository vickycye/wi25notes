### Quick Notes
- Reduction factor changes the closed form
- The sum inside the red box for each row doesn't have to add up to 1
- For homework and exams, best to show each step (what rule, what formula) is used when reducing the summation to closed form.
### To do
- [ ] Finish section worksheet 
- [ ] Review T(n-1) form tree method and simplifying to closed form
- [ ] Comment on the EX02 project
- [ ] Submit EX02 project, following the specs
- [ ] Start EX03 project

### Section Notes

To find the closed form:
- Use the geometric series sum rule to simplify the summation formula.
- Then, use properties of logs and exponents

### Tips for EX03
- Identify the number of running branches that the code has [number of subproblems you have a recursive call rfor]
	- a
- Identify the size of each of the subproblems
	- b
- Identify (asymptotically) the non-recursive running time
	- Ignore constants and non-dominant terms
	- This gives f(n)
- Express running time as T(n) = aT(n / b) + f(n) OR T(n) = aT(n - b) + f(n)
