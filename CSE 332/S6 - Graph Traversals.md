### Quick Notes
- [ ] EX07 released soon

### To do
- [ ] EX06

---
### Section Notes
- Can get minimum spanning tree from BFS after you mark all the predecessors.

### DFS properties
- Can detect if graphs have cycles

### 207. Course Schedule
```java
// use DFS where we track the visited nodes in a boolean array
class Solution {
	public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
		boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCourses];
		LinkedList<Integer> // for storing the traversal of the graph

		// return a true if there isn't a cycle

		// return a false if there is a cycle
	}
	// detext cycle to see if it's impossible to finish a course sequence, 
	// since you won't be able to take those classes

	private boolean 
}

```

**Topological sort for traversal??**
