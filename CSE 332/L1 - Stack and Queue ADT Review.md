- EX0 coming out later tonight (due 1/13)
- look at syllabus again
- read weiss textbook (1.1-1.6, 2.2-2.4)
- ~~preliminary survey fur Thursday (1/09)~~
- learn good Java style
- check out: [Commenting Guide - CSE 123](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse123/23su/resources/commenting/)

## Lecture Notes

- Lots of data structures and their time complexity/memory trade-offs
- Math analysis of algorithms
- Learn how to pick the most efficient data structure for each task

Design -> Analysis -> Implementation

### Stacks and Queue Review

Stacks: LIFO, some operations: push, pop, peek, is_empty (some languages use add :( )
Queue: FIFO, some operations: enqueue, dequeue, is_empty, can implement with arrays
- aka "circular array" since enqueue wraps the "back" of the queue into the front of the array (from the modulus symbol)

### For EX0:

For the project, review [[L1 - Inheritance and Interface]] and [[L3 - More Inheritance and Interface]] from [[CS 211 - Class Details]] for inheritance and interfaces.
